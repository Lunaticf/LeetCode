## 706. Design HashMap

这题也跟之前一题一样是简单题，但是想要设计好的哈希Map就很困难
面试可能涉及的问题
For simplicity, are the keys integers only?
For collision resolution, can we use chaining?
Do we have to worry about load factors?
Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
Can we assume this fits memory?

这里用链表来解决冲突试试
